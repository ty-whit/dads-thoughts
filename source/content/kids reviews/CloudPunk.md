Honestly, I’m a little torn on whether I like the idea of kids playing this game. Teenages are definitely fine to play this game, as the themes are not very heavy at all. Pre-teens might enjoy the cool landscapes and pretty colors, but I’m sure much of the dialog will go right over their heads. Kids younger than about eight are likely to run into skill and coordination issues. There’s not a lot of fast driving or quickly tuned button presses that are a concern, but you do need to be aware of all your surrounding, the cars don’t handle well, and the city blocks can be a bit confusing to navigate. 

The game is very relaxing, however. You take the role of Rania, a country girl from the East, dropped into the cyberpunk dystopia, just trying to earn enough pay through the night’s odd jobs. All the themes of cyberpunk are here: rogue AI, sentient robots, mega corporations, underground crime rings, government corruption, doomsday cults, cybernetic augmentations. However, they are discussed from the perspective of effectively an uber eats or door dash delivery driver, if uber eats or door dash accepted person to person deliveries of mostly illegal goods with strongly encouraged “don’t ask, don’t tell” policies. You are not the hero of Nevalis.
