Play Sticky Business. Have your kids play Sticky Business. End of entry. Done. 

Okay, obviously I’ll explain why, but I do mean it. Everything in this game is perfectly fine to show to your children. I also think your kids should actually play the game themselves. Naturally, this will depend on your child’s ability to manipulate the controls of the game (and platform), but as early as your kid is able to control a curser on screen, I say let them play.
