I started listening to *The Find Out Podcast* this week and came across this gem in the second episode. 
> “I mean, I think one of the other things that's interesting about it too is like, in this day and age, women respond to men who are able to tap into how they feel. And I think that's a huge epicenter of how this is all being framed is like, the alpha men of the right are dudes that don't want to talk about that stuff, right? They just want to get as far away from it as possible.”

I hate that this happened to me. I grew up in a high-control religion, A.K.A. a cult, and between the expected right-leaning political expectations, the undertones of toxic masculinity, the heavy hand of Patriarchy, and the fake happy presentation of everything, I reached a point where I was unable to feel any of my feelings. Growing up with undiagnosed ADHD only exasterbated the intensity of those feelings that I had to hide away, making the need for this mask all the more necessary. 

My specific brand of “not feeling my feelings” was to ”work through” them in the most logical way possible, at least by the time I reached adulthood and “emotional maturity.  Also, I mean logical as in 
* “Why am I experiencing this emotion?” 
* “What triggers am I experiencing right now?” 
* “What in my past may have lead me to react in this way?”
Not “the most logical way”, like just feeling them and allowing them to pass naturally. 
Instead, I acted as my own therapist. The problem with this is obviously that I am not a licensed professional, and I wasn’t seeing one either. In the moments of big feelings, I was either by myself or with my life partner, my wife. The accidental result of this approach was that I would just end up not actually needing to feel them. The questions and “self work” I thought I was doing ended up burying those feelings deeper. I didn’t have to them about them. I didn’t have to feel the uncomfortable pains of anger, sadness, guilt, and regret. I had my mental processes that distracted me from them, and they would go away. I suppose on a technical level, this is better than lashing out in rage or drinking my problems away.
