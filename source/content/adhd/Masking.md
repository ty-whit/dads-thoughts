*Disclamer*
I’m going to say this at the beginning: if you’re neurodivergent, you almost certainly don’t need this article. This article is absolutely for the people who don’t know anything about the experience of having ADHD or Autism. However, if you’re recently diagnosed (self or clinically) or have close family or friends that you want to understand better, this will be a great read. On with the article!

As I was doom scrolling through TikTok one of these days, I came across a [video](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTjsGeyKM/) where the creator performs a skit of how she discovered she had been clinically diagnosed with ADHD as a child. The punchline of the skit was that her parents never told her. Now, as a fully grown adult, she’s finding out and now has to deal with the repercussions of that knowledge. 

Being a hilarious video that I related to in a small degree, I left a comment in the pattern of my dark humor, joking about how my parent’s didn’t want me to have the label, but now I have both ”the label and trauma from years of masking.” It was supposed to be a light hearted “hehehe, fml” millennial dark humor, leave the comment then walk away and never think about it again, type of joke. 

To my surprise, I actually got a response to that comment saying “We’ve really watered down the meaning of trauma haven’t we…”

I would have loved to explain to this user (no picture, no videos on his account, by the way), but they seem to have blocked me after I invited them to DM me rather than hash it out in the comments on a video. Instead, I’ve decided to explain it all here for the world to hear. 

Before getting into its, let’s put a couple things into perspective. Trauma is typically thought about in terms of wartime occurrences or experiences from abuse. These experiences are horrific, and often cause irreparable harm to a person’s psyche. In this article, we are discussing degrees of trauma. If we max out PTSD causing events (like participating in a war or sexual assault) at a 10, my experiences could easily be counted as a 3 or 4. My experiences are minimal at best, but the tricky thing about the body and brain is that it doesn’t give a shit about “objective levels of trauma” and instead works in relative scales for your ability to process and handle the world around you. 

We could make the case that the amount of trauma I’ve experienced due to my struggles caused by neurodivergence is minimal, but there are some things that have caused me difficulties in my daily experience, my relationships with other people, and my relationship with myself. The real issue with trauma is how long you hold onto it. Without allowing yourself the chance to process your trauma, it ends up eating away at your psyche, changing your neurological pathways, creating patterns of thought and actions that can do damage to your self physically and mentally. 

Let’s take some examples: 
# Rejection Sensitivity

One of the wonderful experiences of ADHD is Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria (RSD). With this lovely collector’s item, I feel rejections much more quickly and much more intensely than I “should”. Now, I’m putting quotation marks around “should” because what is the appropriate reaction to rejection? How much emotion is “too much”? A common experience with people with ADHD is an extended range of emotions. My joy experience tends to go from zero to one hundred with the littlest of things. Likewise my anger flies off the handle at the smallest inconvenience. 

To live in this neurotypical world, I’ve had to learn mindfullness and practice a smaller reaction when things don’t go as I expect them to. for example, I know that it’s not the end of the world when I pour way too much garlic powder in my stirfry, but knowing this doesn’t stop the physical reaction I get to completely shutdown (true story by the way). This is a perfect example of RSD: I (my body and brain) perceived a rejection (pouring too much garlic powder in the food I was cooking) to my day when I was in a flow state. I knew the food was going to be horrible now that I fucked it up. I was rejecting myself and my own ability to cook. 

There’s couple ways this leads to trauma being stored in the body. I don’t remember if I specifically knew about RSD at this time, but imagine I didn’t. I’m getting mad about a simple mistake, and now I’m experiencing anger, frustration, and self-degradation, with all of it directed inward. What happens next week when I hit the curb as I’m driving around a corner? Or next month when my boss points out a mistake I made and offers some constructive criticism in hopes that I can perform better? If not given the knowledge that I feel things at a much higher intensity than most people, this simple one-on-one conversation can quickly turn into self-doubt and self-hatred about how I’m the worst person ever. 

In the one response comment I got from that user, he asked “wdym by unpacked?” Without ever knowing that I have ADHD and RSD, I never can give myself the chance to recognize my response patterns. Just like with clinical illnesses in the body, I cannot fight or change what I do not know about. However, just knowing that it’s a thing isn’t enough. You cannot change anything unless you dig back into your past and understand better where you have been. This is what I mean by unpacked. I had to look back at all the times where my anger went off the rails or my depression dragged me down and figure out if it was related to this thing. My body was holding onto all this shit without ever realizing that it was an experience that most people don’t have and that it is out of the range of normalcy. 

# Executive Dysfunction
Another common experience with ADHD is executive dysfunction. Imagine you’re sitting on the couch thinking “I really need to get those dishes done.” But you lack the ability to actually stand up and go to the sink. Instead you sit there and keep scrolling on Reddit. Thirty minutes later, you think to yourself again “dude, what the hell, get up and go do the dishes,” but you don’t move. Next think you know, it’s 1:35 AM, dishes are still dirty, and the guilt sets in.

> You suck. You can’t actually get anything done. You say you’re going to do better next time, but you do this same thing every night. I bet those dishes have been there for a week by now. You can’t get anything done

Turns out there’s a lot of little things you’ve been promising you’re going to do that don’t actually get done for whatever reasons. Promises you make to yourself, your partner, your friends, your family, all broken.
